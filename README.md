# Recetron

[Blazor]: https://dotnet.microsoft.com/apps/aspnet/web-apps/blazor
[Carter]: https://github.com/CarterCommunity/Carter
[MongoDB]: https://mongodb.github.io/mongo-csharp-driver/
[MongoDB Atlas]: https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas
[Heroku]: https://elements.heroku.com/buildpacks/jincod/dotnetcore-buildpack
[Firebase]: https://firebase.google.com/docs/hosting/

This is a simple playground with a "full-stack" C# web application using [Blazor], [Carter] (asp.net) and [MongoDB] (because I might try to migrate from a JS job to a .net job and blazor seems an easy path for that)

If I ever finish this project (will update this line) it will be somewhat a recipe keeper I plan to host it on [Firebase], [Heroku] and [MongoDB Atlas]
