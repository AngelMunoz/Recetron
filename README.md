This is a simple playground with a "full-stack" C# web application using [Blazor], [Carter] (asp.net) and [MongoDB] (because I might try to migrate from a JS job to a .net job and blazor seems an easy path for that)

If I ever finish this project (will update this line) it will be somewhat a recipe keeper I plan to host it on [Firebase], [Heroku] and [MongoDB Atlas].

### Recent Update

.NET6 is out and I have upgraded Carter to v6.0+ Things today are really simple, it's almost like doing verboose F#, although F# still has some advantages when it comes to nullable values (options are better streamlined in the language).

C# Records are a breeze I will switch default to records on my personal projects.

Blazor is still not my cup of tea but, it's one interesting way to get into frontend development if you're a .NET developer who is used to do backend, it's worth your time at least to try and do that switch.

other than that... I liked the transition to .NET6, it simplified some things and the less ceremony the better for me.
